Test the app live: https://axionpay.netlify.app/

For now, I've just built a Simple ReactJS Button that integrates the payment with ethereum, done over Matic Testnet.

## Why Axion ?

1. Easy URL based popup, allowing merchants to easily start accepting crypto payments.
2. Saves money on international orders by reducing comissions.
3. Own your crypto. The payments you receive will be totally owned by you and no other 3rd party or authority.

## To replicate locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` in the cloned directory.
3. Once all the dependencies are installed, Run `npm start`

**You will be required to create a crypto wallet with portis in order to interact with the app.**
